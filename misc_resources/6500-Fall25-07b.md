# Have you ever…
Named a file project_final_2a_updated(2)-FINAL3.py?
Tried to sync changes from a collaborator by hand?
Copied an entire source tree to try things a different way?
NOT tried something because it might break things?
Wanted to compare a file with any past version of itself?
Wished you could share a fixed set of files with your research paper, enabling reproducibility, without preventing further development?
Wondered when in the last N revisions something stopped working?

# Why Should I Care?

![This image is a meme featuring a character wearing sunglasses in a serious pose. The meme contains two lines of text in white capital letters: **Top text:** "WHAT IF I TOLD YOU..." **Bottom text:** "ALL OF THIS AND MORE IS POSSIBLE WITH GIT" The image uses the popular "What If I Told You" meme format (featuring Morpheus from The Matrix) to make a humorous statement about Git, the version control system used in software development. The meme suggests that Git has powerful and perhaps surprising capabilities. At the bottom of the image, there is a small watermark that reads "imgflip.com". This is a typical internet meme format used to convey information or jokes in a recognizable, easily shareable visual format.](Picture2.jpg)
Source Control: versions, diffs, branches – experiment with confidence
Backups: entire history available locally, easy remote sync
Sharing: build a portfolio of work available to the public
Collaborating: work in one shared codebase
the world of Open Source is built on Git
Because Professionals Do…

![# Image Description This image appears to be a screenshot from the 1971 film "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory." It shows the character Willy Wonka, identifiable by his iconic brown top hat and period costume, speaking directly to the camera. ## Embedded Text The image contains white subtitled text at the bottom that reads: "Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination." This is a famous line from the movie, specifically from the song "Pure Imagination" that Wonka sings while introducing visitors to his chocolate factory. ## Visual Context The image has a soft, dreamy quality with a blurred blue-tinted background, which complements the fantastical nature of the quoted text. There is a watermark visible in the top right corner reading "IMPERIALDEMONS." This appears to be used as a meme or motivational image, leveraging the iconic scene and memorable quote about imagination and wonder.

# Git is
Snapshot-based2 distributed3 version control system1 for source files4
“system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later”; stored in a database, repository
“takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot” – not delta-based
every repository is a complete mirror – not client-server model
text files used to make things: code, Markdown, LaTeX, etc., not by-products (binaries, PDFs, etc.)

Git is not GitHub
Related, but NOT the same
Git – creates / maintains local repositories
GitHub – website for remote hosting of GIT repositories
Git is essential for source control, local “backups”
GitHub (or others like it) is powerful option for sharing, collaboration
Git is the original product, others are derivatives

# Command Line: Why?!

![This is a black and white line drawing meme showing a person with their hands raised to their head in a gesture of confusion or frustration. The person's face shows a perplexed or questioning expression with furrowed brows. The image contains two pieces of bold text: - "BUT" appears at the top - "WHY?" appears at the bottom This is a common meme format used to express confusion, bewilderment, or questioning of something that doesn't make sense. The simple line art style and dramatic hand gesture emphasize the emotional reaction of not understanding something. But Why? - Jackie Chan Meme | Meme Generator](Picture4.jpg)
Supports all Git commands
Is explicit – you (can) know exactly what you are doing
If you can learn the CLI version, you can learn the GUI version; reverse harder?
GUI choice personal; all users have CLI
CLI can be automated, etc., etc.
Can focus on actions, less (different) interface overhead

# Basic Workflow and Terminology
Workflow:
Initialize a Git repository (adds folder to existing project)
Add / modify files in the project tree
Decide which files to put under version control
Selectively stage changes when you want to include them
Commit staged changes to the repository
Corresponding file states and project sections:
File states: untracked, modified, tracked, staged, committed
Git project sections: working directory, staging area, repository

	modified	staged	committed

![This is an instructional diagram illustrating the Git version control workflow, showing the relationship between three main areas and the commands that move data between them. **Three Main Areas (from left to right):** 1. "Working Directory" (shown in orange/red box) 2. "Staging Area" (shown in teal/blue-green box) 3. ".git directory (Repository)" (shown in gray box with border) **Arrows and Commands:** - **"Checkout the project"** - A large gray arrow pointing LEFT from the .git directory to both the Working Directory and Staging Area, indicating retrieving project files from the repository - **"Stage Fixes"** - A gray arrow pointing RIGHT from the Working Directory to the Staging Area, showing how changes are staged - **"Commit"** - A gray arrow pointing RIGHT from the Staging Area to the .git directory, showing how staged changes are committed to the repository The diagram uses a simple flow chart format to demonstrate the three-stage process of Git version control: making changes in the working directory, staging those changes, and committing them to the repository. The bidirectional nature of the workflow is emphasized by the checkout arrow going in the opposite direction of the stage and commit arrows.](Picture3.jpg)
Staging area is a file: index of tracked files with info about next commit
The .git directory is a hidden subdirectory of the root project folder, contains the Git database and related metadata

# Command Line Syntax: type 'git'

![# Image Description This is a three-panel comic strip in the style of xkcd, featuring stick figures in a conversation about version control software. ## Embedded Text (verbatim): **Panel 1 (top left speech bubble):** "THIS IS GIT. IT TRACKS COLLABORATIVE WORK ON PROJECTS THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL DISTRIBUTED GRAPH THEORY TREE MODEL." **Panel 2 (top right speech bubble):** "COOL. HOW DO WE USE IT?" **Panel 3 (bottom speech bubble):** "NO IDEA. JUST MEMORIZE THESE SHELL COMMANDS AND TYPE THEM TO SYNC UP. IF YOU GET ERRORS, SAVE YOUR WORK ELSEWHERE, DELETE THE PROJECT, AND DOWNLOAD A FRESH COPY." ## Visual Elements: The comic shows three stick figures. One figure is seated at a computer (shown on the left), one is sitting on a stool in the middle, and one is standing on the right. The humor derives from the contrast between Git's sophisticated theoretical foundation and the crude, non-technical workaround described for actually using it in practice. xkcd 1597](Picture2.jpg)

# Git Command Line Syntax
Simplified form:  git [<flags>] <command> [<args>]
We will focus on a few key commands that give major benefits
A few minutes to learn, a lifetime to master…

I will demonstrate, using only about 10 commands:
Intro to git commands: initial configuration with git config
Working with a local repo:  init, status, add, commit
Cloning remote repos: clone, pull / fetch
Working with your own remote repos using GitHub CLI, push

# 1. Intro Git Commands
First thing after installation – configuration
Git is absurdly configurable, managed by config command
Only one essential change: name and email, baked into commits
	command	option              	arguments

![# Image Description This image shows command-line instructions for configuring Git user settings. It contains two terminal commands displayed on a dark background with syntax highlighting: ## Embedded Text (verbatim): ``` $ git config --global user.name "John Doe" $ git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com" ``` ## Instructional Content: The image demonstrates **Git configuration commands** used to set global user identity: 1. **First command**: Sets the user's name to "John Doe" 2. **Second command**: Sets the user's email to "johndoe@example.com" Both commands use: - The `git config` command - The `--global` flag (applies settings to all repositories for the current user) - User identity parameters (`user.name` and `user.email`) - String values in quotation marks (yellow/gold highlighting) This is typical instructional content found in Git tutorials or documentation, showing how to perform initial Git setup on a new system.](Picture5.jpg)
Enter the command as shown above
Do not include the $ (shell prompt), use your own details
Check the results:

![# Image Description This image shows a command-line interface instruction for Git configuration. It contains: ## Command Text ``` $ git config user.name John Doe ``` ## Visual Details - The text is displayed on a dark background (appears to be a terminal/command prompt) - The command prompt is indicated by a dollar sign (`$`) - The command being executed is `git config user.name` - The output shows the configured username as `John Doe` - Text appears in a monospace font typical of terminal applications - The command text is shown in a light color (possibly tan/beige) while the output is in white ## Instructional Context This appears to be an educational or documentation example demonstrating how to check the currently configured Git username using the `git config` command. It's showing both the command syntax and the expected output format.](Picture6.jpg)

# Gitting Help
For comprehensive help on a topic:  git help <command>
e.g.,  git help config
uses “man page” (manual) interface: scroll, page, / for find, q quit
For more concise help:  git <command> -h
e.g.,  git config –h
Or with your new friend, tldr: tldr git <command>
Chet aka ChattieG is VERY GOOD at git
Google search results may also be confusing, out of date, etc., especially at first; best as support for primary / secondary references

# 2. Work with a Local Repo

![This image appears to be a Git command reference guide displayed on a dark background (likely from a terminal or command-line interface). It shows a list of basic Git commands with their descriptions: **Commands and descriptions (verbatim text):** ``` git init # create a new repo in current directory git status # reports repo status - modified, staged files git add <filename> # adds files to staging area git commit # commits staged files with snapshot git log # shows flattened log of history git diff <filename> # shows changes between current and staged ``` The layout uses a two-column format where: - Left column: Git commands in cyan/turquoise color - Right column: Explanatory comments preceded by `#` in gray color This is a basic instructional reference showing fundamental Git version control commands that beginners would typically learn first, covering the workflow of initializing a repository, checking status, staging files, committing changes, viewing history, and comparing differences.](Picture3.jpg)
Goal: Use git for local version control
Initialize a project
Check the status
Add files to staging area
Commit changes
Look at log and diffs

<!-- Slide number: 22 -->

![This image shows a terminal/shell interface demonstrating Git version control commands. The content is titled "21 - Local Repo" at the top. The shell commands shown include: ``` cd chp05 ls # preview files, esp. markdown git init # note change to prompt, added .git git status # discuss status git add . # . = all files in this directory git status # show changes git commit # commit everything to the repo git status # show changes git log # discuss history # edit README.md git diff README.md # discuss output git add README.md # add changes for next commit git status git commit -m "updated readme" git status git log ls # working directory as normal ``` The text in the upper right corner shows "Shell" in red/pink text. The commands demonstrate a typical Git workflow including: - Initializing a repository - Checking status - Adding files - Making commits - Viewing differences and history - Working with a README.md file Comments (preceded by #) provide instructional context for each command, explaining what should be discussed or noting important observations.](Picture3.jpg)

# Another Side-Quest: Useful Prompt
Do this:
nano ~/.bashrc
Add: export PS1="\n\w\n\u@\h > ”
Save and exit nano
source ~/.bashrc
What this does:
Edit the bash configuration file
Sets an environment variable that defines the prompt template
Reads the bash configuration file
Interactive prompt generator: https://ezprompt.net/
Warning: slippery slope! 💀

![This image appears to be an instructional diagram explaining command prompt or terminal notation elements. It shows five bullet points, each with a symbol and its meaning: • `\u` - your username • `\h` - your computer name • `\w` - current directory path • `\n` - newline • `$` - prompt symbol Each symbol is displayed in a dark rounded rectangle with red/coral colored text on a dark background. The explanatory text is in white. This appears to be educational content explaining the meaning of different elements commonly seen in shell prompts or command-line interfaces, particularly in Unix-like systems where these escape sequences are used to customize the prompt display.](Picture7.jpg)

# .gitignore
Need a way to exclude files from the repo, e.g.:
Logs and temporary files
Operating system files (.DS_Store on macos, Thumbs.db on win)
Outputs
Keys and credentials
Generated / compiled files
Virtual environments!
Large / binary files
Git is for source code – the text files that make things

![This image is an instructional guide explaining how to revert a file to a previous version in Git. Here's the content: # Header Question: **"I made a change to a file and committed it to git, but I need to go back to a previous version. What is the easiest way to do that? Please be concise."** # Response: **No problem! Here's the easiest way:** ## **1. Find the commit you want to go back to:** ```bash git log ``` This shows your commit history. Find the commit hash (the long string of letters/numbers) for the version you want. ## **2. Revert the file to that version:** ```bash git checkout <commit-hash> -- <filename> ``` For example: ```bash git checkout a1b2c3d -- myfile.txt ``` ## **3. Commit the change:** ```bash git commit -m "Reverted file to previous version" ``` That's it! Your file is now back to the old version. **Tip:** Press `q` to exit the `git log` view. The image uses a dark theme with code blocks displayed in darker gray boxes, with "bash" labels, and Git commands highlighted in blue syntax coloring.

# What’s the worst that could happen?
With these commands – confusion
Experiment with small test projects first
Need a clean start? – delete the .git folder and re-initialize repo
lose history, working copy unchanged
Git is almost always additive
Hard to lose data, by design (meant to be a record of changes)
More “dangerous” commands are highlighted in Git Pro
Can do a lot with just what we’ve covered so far, learn more as you go

# 3. Clone a Remote Repo
Typical Use Case: found a book, course, or other repo you want to work from, e.g.
HOML 2: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2
INSY6500: https://github.com/olearydj/INSY6500
Any repo on GitHub or other git “remotes” (web, server, local)
Goal: Create a local copy of those files, able to easily update
Want to keep up with author’s changes, will accept them “as is”
Limited local changes, mostly in new files
No plan to share changes with the author

# Git Clone + Pull

![# Image Description This image shows a reference guide for basic Git commands displayed as white/green text on a dark background, formatted like terminal or command-line instructions. ## Embedded Text (verbatim): ``` git clone <url> # creates local copy of repo git remote -v # show linked remote repos git pull # get changes and merge ``` ## Content Analysis: This is an instructional reference chart showing three fundamental Git commands: 1. **git clone <url>** - Used to create a local copy of a repository 2. **git remote -v** - Used to display linked remote repositories 3. **git pull** - Used to retrieve changes and merge them Each command is followed by a descriptive comment (indicated by the `#` symbol) explaining its purpose. The layout uses a consistent format with the command on the left and the explanation on the right, making it easy to scan and understand the basic Git workflow operations.](Picture3.jpg)
e.g.: git clone https://github.com/olearydj/clone_demo
Creates directory clone_demo and initializes .git directory inside
Pulls down all data for that repository
Checks out a working copy of the latest version
Time to update? git pull
gets updates on the remote repo
tries to merge them with the current branch
Demo deviates / expands on this with fetch and diff

# What’s the worst that could happen?
Adding your own files – add, commit without worries (optional)
Editing author’s files can create conflicts, gets sticky!
you change a file, then the author changes it
pull → merge changes, which to keep: yours, authors, both, how?
Either don’t modify cloned files or
Learn to merge and
Use git fetch and merge selectively
Simple, zero risk option – keep your notes in a separate folder (with its own repo); treat clone as a reference only
PS: clone → all history, can be large: use --depth=1 for shallow clone

# 4. Work with Your Own Remote Repo
Share publicly or as a private copy for backup and/or synchronization
Goal: Create a remote copy of a local repo, sync changes
Primarily interested in pushing local changes to the remote
May also want to pull down changes from remote
For this example we’ll use GitHub
Other hosts exist (e.g GitLab, BitBucket)
Remotes can also be on local server or even another local copy
To manipulate GitHub from the command line you need another tool

# Clone Local Repo to GitHub
In the local repo:  gh repo create
choose ‘Push existing local repo…’ and follow prompts
Details: Add existing project to GitHub using the command line

![This image shows a terminal/command-line interface demonstrating the use of the GitHub CLI tool to create a new repository. Here's the content with embedded text: **Command executed:** `git_demo git:(master) ➜ gh repo create` **Interactive prompts and responses:** ``` ? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub ? Path to local repository . ? Repository name git_demo ? Description demostration repo for INFORMS talk, Intro to Git ? Visibility Private ✓ Created repository olearydj/git_demo on GitHub ? Add a remote? Yes ? What should the new remote be called? origin ✓ Added remote https://github.com/olearydj/git_demo.git ? Would you like to push commits from the current branch to the "origin"? Yes ✓ Pushed commits to https://github.com/olearydj/git_demo.git ``` The image illustrates a step-by-step process where: 1. The user initiates repository creation from an existing local directory 2. Sets the repository name as "git_demo" 3. Adds a description indicating it's for an INFORMS talk about Git 4. Sets visibility to Private 5. Successfully creates the repository on GitHub 6. Adds a remote named "origin" 7. Pushes commits to the newly created GitHub repository Each completed action is marked with a checkmark (✓), while prompts are marked with a question mark (?).](Picture3.jpg)

# Work with Your Own Remote Repo

![This image shows a command-line shell interface with Git commands and instructional comments. The interface has a dark background with syntax-highlighted text. **Embedded text verbatim:** ``` gh repo create # follow prompts, use defaults git fetch git diff origin/master git merge # just the merge step, no need to pull again git push ``` The word "Shell" appears in red text in the upper right corner. **Instructional content:** This is a sequence of Git/GitHub commands demonstrating a typical workflow: 1. Creating a repository using GitHub CLI (`gh repo create`) 2. Fetching updates from remote (`git fetch`) 3. Comparing differences with the remote master branch (`git diff origin/master`) 4. Merging changes (`git merge`) 5. Pushing changes to remote (`git push`) The commands include explanatory comments (indicated by `#`) that provide guidance on usage, such as following prompts with defaults and noting that the merge step alone is sufficient without pulling again.](Picture3.jpg)
Same methods + push

# Collaboration: Small to Medium Teams
Devs clone the repo,
make changes,
push them,
pull changes from others,
merge as necessary

![This image is a diagram illustrating a centralized workflow system. The diagram shows: **Structure:** - At the top: A gold/yellow rectangular box labeled "shared repository" - At the bottom: Three orange rectangular boxes, each labeled "developer" - Arrows connecting these elements: bidirectional arrows between the shared repository and each of the three developer boxes, indicating two-way communication/data flow **Embedded text:** - "shared repository" (in the gold box at top) - "developer" (repeated three times in the orange boxes at bottom) - "Figure 53. Centralized workflow" (caption below the diagram) The diagram visually represents how multiple developers interact with a central repository, with arrows showing that developers both push to and pull from the shared repository. This is a common pattern in version control systems where all team members work with a single central codebase.](Picture3.jpg)
Merges can be tricky – managed by tools, mitigated by practices

# Collaboration Practices
Strategies to minimize overlap – don’t put everything in one file and all work on it at the same time!
Break work into many files, by functional groups (UI, save, load, etc.)
Have team members specialize in certain functional areas
Use branching / merging techniques

Dan O'Leary - Industrial & Systems Engineering, Auburn University - INSY 6500

<!-- Slide number: 38 -->
# Other Considerations
Git is designed for text-based file formats (code, markup languages, csv, etc.) – refrain from using it with others, esp. large or binary files
Use .gitignore, put those files in cloud, etc. (secure, backups)
Data version control tools exist, critical complement for ML, etc.
NEVER include sensitive information (e.g. passwords, API/SSH/AWS keys, CC numbers, PIN numbers, etc.) in files you push to a public repository
Use configuration files, environment variables, or more sophisticated methods to secure this data outside the repo
Write good commit messages

![This image is a classic instructional visualization of an iceberg, demonstrating the concept that most of an iceberg's mass lies hidden beneath the water's surface. The image is split into two distinct sections: **Above Water (Visible Portion):** - Shows a white and blue ice formation rising from the ocean surface - Features jagged peaks and snow-covered surfaces - Set against a light blue sky with white clouds - The visible portion appears relatively modest in size **Below Water (Hidden Portion):** - Reveals a massive underwater ice structure significantly larger than the visible tip - Displays intricate textures, ridges, and crevasses in various shades of blue - The submerged ice appears darker and more complex in structure - Extends deep into the turquoise-blue water This visualization is commonly used as a metaphor in instructional contexts to illustrate concepts such as: - Hidden complexity or depth beneath surface appearances - Unconscious mind versus conscious awareness - Underlying factors in business, psychology, or risk assessment - The importance of looking beyond what is immediately visible **Embedded text:** None visible in this image. The image serves as a powerful educational tool demonstrating the physical principle that approximately 90% of an iceberg's volume remains submerged, making it an effective diagram for teaching about proportion, perception, and hidden dimensions.

# Next Steps: Git Some!

![This image is a four-panel meme format showing a conversation between two characters. The panels contain the following text: **Panel 1 (top left):** "I write code!" **Panel 2 (top right):** "In an IDE Right..." **Panel 3 (bottom left):** No text - shows reaction shot **Panel 4 (bottom right):** "In an IDE?" The meme appears to be making a joke about software development, specifically about whether someone writes code in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or not. The format shows an escalating conversation where the first person's claim about writing code is questioned, creating a humorous exchange about their development practices. At the bottom of the image, there is a watermark that reads "imgflip.com"](Picture2.jpg)
Use it regularly – “perishable skill”
Continue with the CLI, set up Git integration in your IDE, and/or supplement with simple GUI (GitHub Desktop) – see how CLI commands translate
Migrate to more text-based workflows, e.g. using Markdown, Notebooks, LaTeX, etc. for notes (Obsidian), publishing (RStudio), etc.
