![This image appears to be a book cover or promotional material for "Exploratory Data Analysis" by John W. Tukey. The layout is split into two halves: **Left side:** A black and white portrait photograph of John W. Tukey, showing him in professional attire with a striped tie. **Right side:** An orange background containing: **Title text:** - "John W. Tukey" (top) - "EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS" (large white text in center) **Data visualization:** A boxed diagram showing what appears to be statistical charts including: - Horizontal bar charts or stem-and-leaf plots on the left side - A vertical bar chart/histogram on the right side - Numerical data listed at the bottom showing values like: - Lines numbered 7-15 - Various numerical sequences including: - "0|147" - "0|233334679" - "1|133345577788" - "2|001344578899999" - "3|0000111122234455677789" - And several more rows of numerical data - Ending with "6879" The visualization appears to demonstrate exploratory data analysis techniques, likely stem-and-leaf plots and frequency distributions, which are fundamental tools in the statistical methodology that Tukey pioneered.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Classical statistics mostly focused on inference
drawing conclusions about large populations from a sample
e.g., height of adult women in the US: calculate the point estimate, CI, test if it significantly differs from other groups (e.g., adult men)
John W. Tukey founded the field of Data Science
1962, “The Future of Data Science” – new discipline, called for reform in stats
1977, “Exploratory Data Analysis” – boxplots and summary stats
Connected stats, engineering, comp sci (coined the terms bit and software!)
Today, data and compute are plentiful, field has grown in scope and prestige / value

# Structured vs Unstructured Data
Unstructured
no predefined format, unorganized
streams of pixels, text, user actions, etc.
Structured
Organized into a predefined format with clear fields
database tables, spreadsheets, etc. – tabular row / column / cell
also: hierarchical, network / graph, key-value pairs, time series
Semi-Structured
combines structure (e.g. hierarchy) with unstructured elements
JSON, XML – hierarchy of key-value pairs

# Types of Data
Numerical
Data expressed on a numeric scale
Continuous – measured values; e.g., wind speed or time duration (float)
Discrete – counted values; e.g., number of students or defect count (int)
Categorical
Data that can only take on a fixed set of values (enums, factors)
Nominal – no inherent order; e.g., state name, hair color
Ordinal – categories have a meaningful order
Even intervals; e.g. Likert scale (1-5 ratings with equal differences)
Uneven intervals; e.g. education level (differences aren’t assumed equal)
Binary – only two allowable values; e.g., 0/1, yes/no, true/false

# Categories are Important
Data type important factor when deciding…
how to effectively visualize
the kinds of analysis to perform
what kind of model to build
how to verify and validate the methods and results
Validation – “did we build the right thing?” (formulation)
does the solution answer the question(s) of interest
are the conclusions meaningful and useful
Verification – “did we build the thing right?” (implementation)
does the solution work correctly and produce technically accurate results

# Tabular / Rectangular Data Terminology
DataFrame – the core tabular data structure for DS and ML
Feature – a column in the DF, aka attribute, column, input, predictor, (independent) variable
Outcome – the variable of interest, aka dependent variable, response, target, output
Record – a row within the table, aka example, instance, observation, sample, row

![# Image Description: Data Table Format This image shows **Table 1-1** titled "A typical data frame format" The table contains 8 rows of data with the following column headers: - **Category** - **currency** - **sellerRating** - **Duration** - **endDay** - **ClosePrice** - **OpenPrice** - **Competitive?** ## Data Content: **First two rows:** - Category: Music/Movie/Game - currency: US - sellerRating: 3249 - Duration: 5 - endDay: Mon - ClosePrice: 0.01 - OpenPrice: 0.01 - Competitive?: 0 **Remaining six rows:** - Category: Automotive - currency: US - sellerRating: 3115 - Duration: 7 - endDay: Tue - ClosePrice: 0.01 - OpenPrice: 0.01 - Competitive?: Varies (0 for first four rows, 1 for last two rows) The table demonstrates a typical data frame structure with mixed data types including categorical variables (Category, currency, endDay), numerical values (sellerRating, Duration, prices), and binary indicators (Competitive?).](Picture6.jpg)
Can You Identify:continuous / discrete, categorical (nominal, ordinal, binary),feature, outcome, record, value

### Notes:
Whether sellerRating is ordinal categorical or discrete numerical
Whether days of week (endDay) should be considered cyclical/periodic
Whether ClosePrice/OpenPrice are truly continuous given they're monetary values (technically discrete to the penny)
Why some rows appear to be duplicates
Whether Duration is continuous or discrete (it's discrete as shown but could theoretically be continuous)

<!-- Slide number: 9 -->
# Interpreting Datanature of data + goals of analysis → data type choices
sellerRating appears to be discrete numerical data (3249, 3115, etc.)
Which interpretation might be most valuable?
Raw discrete numeric?
Binned into ordinal categories? (poor < fair < good < excellent)
Normalized into a continuous variable? (0-1 scale, for example)
Simplified to binary? (above / below mean or median)
Tradeoffs:
Ease identification / interpretation of patterns
Reduce noise and/or lose precision
Influenced by chosen cutoff points (bias?)

# Descriptive / Summary Statistics
Get a sense of the “shape” of data
Measures of location: mean, median, mode, etc.
Describe centrality, average position
Measures of variability: std deviation, variance, range, IQR, etc.
Describe dispersion, spread of values
Different from “inferential statistics” – related to hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.
Pandas: df.describe()
No single statistic is sufficient

# Anscombe’s Quartet

![# Image Description: Four Scatter Plots with Linear Regression Lines This image contains four scatter plots arranged in a 2x2 grid, each showing the relationship between different x and y variables with fitted linear regression lines. ## Layout and Common Features: - All plots have the same axis ranges: x-axis from 4 to 18, y-axis from 3 to 13 - Each plot contains orange circular data points with black outlines - Blue linear regression lines are fitted through the data points in each plot - All plots show positive correlations between x and y variables ## Individual Plot Details: **Top Left (x₁ vs y₁):** - Shows moderate scatter around the regression line - Data points are fairly well distributed along the trend line - Some vertical deviation from the fitted line is visible **Top Right (x₂ vs y₂):** - Shows a cluster of points concentrated in the middle-right region (around x=10-14, y=8-10) - Points show moderate scatter around the regression line - One notable outlier appears at approximately (4, 3) **Bottom Left (x₃ vs y₃):** - Shows the tightest fit to the regression line among all four plots - Points follow the linear trend very closely - Two potential outliers appear: one around (14, 13) and another around (15, 9) **Bottom Right (x₄ vs y₄):** - Shows a distinctive bimodal pattern with clusters of points - Most points cluster at two locations: around (8, 5-9) and at (18, 12.5) - This plot shows the poorest linear fit, suggesting a potential non-linear or categorical relationship The plots appear to be demonstrating Anscombe's Quartet or a similar statistical concept, where datasets with similar statistical properties can have very different distributions and relationships. undefined](Picture2.jpg)

# Exploring the Data Distribution
These measures express the data with a single value, insufficient
Supplement with appropriate visual exploration methods
Boxplots, Histograms, Density Plots for continuous numerical data
Boxplots
median value
IQR
the range of “most data” (typically 1.5 x IQR)
outliers

![# Image Description This image shows a box plot (box-and-whisker plot) displaying population data measured in millions. ## Key Elements: **Axes:** - **Y-axis**: Labeled "Population (millions)" with scale ranging from 0 to approximately 35 million - **X-axis**: Labeled "Population" (categorical) **Box Plot Components:** - **Box**: Extends approximately from 2 million to 7 million - **Median line** (green/orange horizontal line inside box): Located at approximately 4 million - **Whiskers**: - Lower whisker extends to approximately 1 million - Upper whisker extends to approximately 13 million - **Outliers** (shown as circles): Four data points appear above the upper whisker at approximately: - 19 million - 19 million (second point) - 25 million - 37 million The visualization demonstrates a right-skewed distribution with several high-value outliers, suggesting most population values cluster in the lower range (1-7 million) with a few significantly larger populations.](Picture6.jpg)

![This image shows a combination histogram and density plot displaying murder rate data per 100,000 population. **Chart Elements:** - **X-axis:** Labeled "Murder Rate (per 100,000)" ranging from 0 to 12 - **Y-axis:** Labeled "Density" ranging from 0.00 to 0.25 **Visual Components:** 1. **Blue Histogram Bars:** Show the frequency distribution of murder rates, with the highest concentration between approximately 2-7 per 100,000. The bars show a somewhat bimodal distribution with peaks around 2-3 and 5-6. 2. **Orange Curve:** A smoothed kernel density estimate (KDE) overlay that follows the general shape of the histogram. The curve shows two prominent peaks around 2-3 and 5-6 per 100,000, with the first peak being slightly higher (around 0.17-0.18 density). The curve tapers off smoothly toward both ends, with a long tail extending to the right toward higher murder rates. The visualization effectively illustrates that most observations cluster in the lower to middle range of murder rates, with relatively few cases showing very high rates (above 8 per 100,000).](Picture6.jpg)
# Exploring the Data Distribution
Histograms
visualizes a frequency table – the count of values in bins over the range
empty bins included, bins of equal width, number of bins is a parameter
number of bins influences interpretation: more → smooth, less → noise
datasets w/ 1-10k rows: bins = sqrt(n), other recommendations exist
Density
adds estimate of the underlying distribution to histogram

# Binary and Categorical Data

![This image shows a bar chart displaying flight delay data organized by cause of delay. ## Chart Details: **Title/Labels:** - Y-axis: "Count" (ranging from 0 to 120000) - X-axis: "Cause of delay" **Categories and approximate values:** 1. **Carrier**: ~65,000 count 2. **ATC**: ~85,000 count 3. **Weather**: ~12,000 count 4. **Security**: ~0 count (essentially no visible bar) 5. **Inbound**: ~120,000 count (highest bar) ## Key Observations: The chart shows that "Inbound" delays have the highest count at approximately 120,000 occurrences, followed by "ATC" (Air Traffic Control) at around 85,000. "Carrier" delays account for about 65,000 instances, while "Weather" has a much smaller impact at roughly 12,000. "Security" delays are negligible, showing virtually no count on the chart. All bars are displayed in a dark blue/teal color against a white background with a simple grid structure.](Picture6.jpg)
Proportions and/or percentages tell the data’s story
Mode – most commonly occurring value (category)
Expected value – probability-weighted average value
Commonly represented by Bar Chart (no pie charts!!)
categories represented on the x-axis, counts on the y
similar to histogram (bins ≈ categories)
histogram bars touch, with gaps indicating empty bins
in a bar chart, the bars are shown separate from one another

# Types of Analysis
Univariate Analysis – one variable at a time
Bivariate / Multivariate Analysis – two or more variables at a time
concerned with how variables relate to one another
bivariate for two, e.g. correlation, scatter plots, t-tests
multivariate for more, e.g. contingency table, multiple regression, principle component analysis
In both cases the appropriate types of analysis (e.g. summary statistics and visualizations) depends on the nature of the data: numeric or categorical
